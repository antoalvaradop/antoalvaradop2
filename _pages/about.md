I’m a PhD student at the University of Michigan’s Romance Languages and Literatures Department. My research focuses on the politics of illness and care in Latin American literature and culture. Employing an interdisciplinary and situated approach, I seek to examine how productivism and gender norms influence the conceptualization of illness, and how these prevailing beliefs often extend beyond the confines of scientific evidence.  Additionally, I am interested in the forms of resistance within Spanish-speaking digital communities, where patients with poorly understood conditions seek validation, support and information on their conditions after facing inadequate care and stigmatization in the medical system.
